Gnome News is currently unmaintained. I would love to reactivate it but i dont like python as
programming language for a project like that. So i try here to recreate gnome news in vala
with all special features we recently got: Composite Widgets, Gresource files, DBus Integration,
Tracker RSS Miner etc.

**NOTE: This project is in no direct connection to the GNOME trademark or desktop. Its an independent
development and will never be part of GNOME. I just lend the free design for this application**
